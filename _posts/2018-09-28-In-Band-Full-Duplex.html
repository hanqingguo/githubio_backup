<a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">Gnuradio</a> is a Software Defined Radio(SDR) platform. USRPs are devices to transmit and receive radios.
This paper shows steps to cancel Self-Interference by Deep-Learning.
<p>Detailed paper can be found in arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01498">

<h2>Simulation Principle</h2>

<p>
The novel idea of cancelling SI is extract known SI signal from received signals.
To prove the possibility of SI cancellation, a simulation was designated.

<h2>Step1: Sensing</h2>
<p>This step sending known signal to probe SI channel. The designated probing signals will pass the SI channel and transform to unknown received SI signals denoted by
<code>y<sub>si</sub></code></p>

<h2>Step2: Collect Synchronized Data</h2>
<p>Following the SI channel probing, the framework collects and records I and Q components of both the probing complex signals <code>x</code> and the received SI signal <code>y<sub>si</sub></code>.
Since USRPs always start with random time delay, we use barker code embedded to each frame to Synchronize, thus making sure <code>x</code> and <code>y<sub>si</sub></code> is one to one mapping
</p>

<h2>Step3: Train SI channel</h2>

  <p>With the data of <code>x</code> and <code>y<sub>si</sub></code> collected, they are then used to train a DNN SI channel
model in a supervised learning way. The structure of the DNN
SI channel model is explained in my recent publication</p>

<h2>Step4: Load SI channel</h2>
  <p>We write a load module in Gnuradio as an OOT block, in this module, it load DNN parameters by using <code>model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))</code>, then process any input stream through the DNN to estimate <code>y<sub>si</sub>[n]</code></p>
